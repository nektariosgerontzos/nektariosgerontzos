About

  I am currently pursuing my university degree in Applied Informatics at University of Macedonia. As a student, i
like coding on my own projects, studying and expanding my knowledge in Computer and Data Science. I am a
nice fun and friendly person and i work very well in a team, but also on my own, as i like to set my own goals
which i'm constantly trying to achieve. I have a creative mind and am always up for new challenges..
